# Exploratory-Analysis-of-Air-Quality-Missouri

## Why
I was interested in exploring the EPA's air quality index (AQI) because air pollution is an ongoing issue that impacts millions of americans each year, especially those in low income areas. I hoped I would be able to uncover actionable insights affecting the state in which I live, Missouri. 

## Goal
My goal was to create a time series graph for each county in Missouri, documenting each pollutant and that county's air quality to see if I could uncover any patterns across counties.
Unfortunately this turned out to be impossible because on inspection there was not data recorded for AQI or for each pollutant for each county, making the insights I could draw limited. 

## Reflection
My main takeaway from this experience is the limitations and roadblocks that real data presents often limit what an analyst can do. Furthermore, I gained a new appreciation of good quality data and the techniques we have to increase the usability of low quality data.
